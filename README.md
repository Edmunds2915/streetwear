# Basic e-commerce website

Here is my latest learning project. The plan is to have a snazzy menu to browse a streetwear catalogue, with the ability to create an account so you can make mock purchases and view your order history. At a later stage I may add a legitimate stock item and a payment method.

Stack:
-HTML
-CSS
-JS
-PHP

Learning outcomes:
-working with authentication: security, storage, user info and the like.
-level up my CSS and UI design.
-try out some object-oriented PHP on the backend.
-create a website with multiple routes.
-apply Git best practices.
-add tests after the fact (can't start with tests if you don't know how to write them).

Here are some resources I will be using for learning/reference:
-Learn CSS Layout the Pedantic Way (link: http://book.mixu.net/css)
-PHP the Right Way (link: https://phptherightway.com/)
