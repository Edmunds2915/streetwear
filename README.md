# Basic e-commerce website

Here is my latest learning project. The plan is to have a snazzy menu to browse a streetwear catalogue, with the ability to create an account so you can make mock purchases and view your order history. At a later stage I may add a legitimate stock item and a payment method.

Stack: HTML, CSS, JS, PHP

Learning outcomes:<br>
-working with authentication: security, storage, user info and the like.<br>
-level up my CSS and UI design.<br>
-try out some object-oriented PHP on the backend.<br>
-create a website with multiple routes.<br>
-apply Git best practices.<br>
-add tests after the fact (can't start with tests if you don't know how to write them).

Here are some resources I will be using for learning/reference:<br>
-Learn CSS Layout the Pedantic Way (link: http://book.mixu.net/css)<br>
-PHP the Right Way (link: https://phptherightway.com/)<br>
-the Gitflow workflow (link: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
